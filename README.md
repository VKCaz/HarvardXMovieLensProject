# HarvardXMovieLensProject

This repository contains the final submission of the MovieLens project which forms part of the edX HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate capstone.

It contains files of the following types:
1. R script
2. R markdown
3. pdf

Please note that the MovieLens R script and R markdown files may take upward of 1 hour to run due to the massive data structures dealt with during the matrix factorization process.
