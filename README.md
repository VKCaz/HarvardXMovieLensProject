# HavardXDataScienceCapstone

This repository contains the final submission of the MovieLens project and the Choose Your Own project which form part of the edX HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate capstone.

It contains two files of each of the following types:
1. R script
2. R markdown
3. pdf

Additionally, it contains a Data folder containing the data files needed for the Predict Backing Ratio project.

Please note that the MovieLens R script and R markdown files may take upward of 1 hour to run due to the massive data structures dealt with during the matrix factorization process.
